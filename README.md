# Shopping System Application
We need to design a database for an online shopping system. This system has the following requirements:
- A user has id, username, password, full name, address, phone number, email 
- A user can login into the system (assuming that he/she has already registered).
- A user can list a product for sale. A product has: id, name, description, price, quantity. It is assumed that each product is listed by only a user. However, products can have similar name and description. For example, two users can sell the same Apple iPhone 13. However, those products will have different id numbers and potentially different price or quantity.  
- A user can buy a listed product. After the order is made, the product quantity will be deducted accordingly. Note: a user can sell multiple products at the same time. And a user can buy multiple products (from different sellers) in the same order.
